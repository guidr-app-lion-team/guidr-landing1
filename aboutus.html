          <h3>Tim Hoang</h3>
          <p>
            Tim. I’m in Houston, TX. Worked in the medical field for 2.5 years
            and switched over to tech to seek more freedom in life. Took a year
            off to teach myself to code. I built websites for clients, started
            with freecodecamp/udemy, and coded with local developers. I like
            playing with GatsbyJS and React. Love to travel and currently
            learning Spanish. I read, hike, and meditate. I definitely want to
            hit the Southeast Asia corridor at some point: Koh Lanta, Hoi An,
            Bali, Cebu, Kaohsiung. Been through Hawaii, Canada, Japan, Europe,
            Latin America, South America.

          <h3>Matthew Basile</h3>
          <p>
            Hey Gang, I’m Matt from Brooklyn NY! I previously worked in Social
            Media and Finance but stoked to be moving to programming. I’ve been
            coding front-end on and off for the past two years but have been
            loving the concentrated dive here at Lambda. I’m a big NFL/fantasy
            football fan, unfortunately I’m a Jets fan but life goes on lol.
            Next dream vaca is either Patagonia, Tokyo or Berlin. Lots of
            options but I want to go somewhere I’ve never been before!

          <h3>Asa-Michael Shalom</h3>
          <p>
            1.) My name is Asa which is pronounced Ace-uh. 2.) I have been
            blessed with doing many great things in my life, but the only tech
            back ground I come from is being and old school mmorpg player. So no
            coding or programming background prior to Lambda School. 3.) My
            current hobby is going to the gym sunday-friday at lunch, but I only
            started this after we came back from holiday so only 3 or 4 weeks
            now? I also just started coloring with/for my 6 year old daughter.
            Again I have only been doing that for about a month. 4.) I currently
            live in Albuquerque NM (not a big fan), I was born in Salt Lake
            City, Utah and have lived in 12 states plus England, Scotland, and
            Wales. Dream vacation would be Thailand where I have friends but I
            have never been there

          <h3>Jamie Goodnight</h3>
          <p>
            I'm Jamie! I'm from alllll over, but I live in Knoxville, Tennessee
            right now. Before that I lived in NYC for 6 years. I've also lived
            in other places throughout Tennessee, Ohio, and West Virginia. I was
            an actor! No technology background for me. It was really the
            opposite of technological—frilly collars, old-timey accents, and
            playing all the characters who get syphilis in every Ibsen play. I
            currently am really into goldfish. I have two fancy oranda goldfish.
            Their names are Knobby Russet and Honeycrisp, named after apple
            cultivars. The one in the pic is Knobby Russet. I also have a cat
            named Vincent. I'm a vegetarian. I'm not weird about it. I'd really
            like to visit Jordan and see Petra!

          <h3>Itel Domingo</h3>
          <p>
            Hi everyone! My name is Itel from Los Angeles, CA I previously
            worked as a flight attendant. Being on that job is amazing but it is
            time for me to move on to something that I was yearning for. From
            self taught, I joined a coding bootcamp so I have a little
            experience in UX/UI and joined Lambda to expand my knowledge in
            coding. I started to swim again every weekend and liking flag
            football. I’ve travelled pretty much in a lot of countries as it is
            part of my previous work. My dream vacation would be in Korea, Japan
            and Alaska (to see the Aurora Borealis).
